# ConceptEvo
ConceptEvo is a unified interpretation framework that reveals the inception and evolution of concepts during DNN training. For detialed insights behind ConceptEvo, refer to the ðŸ“„[ConceptEvo paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16475).

## About ConceptEvo
ConceptEvo generates a **unified semantic space** that enables side-by-side comparison of different models during training. This space is a visual and analytic tool that facilitates a deeper understanding of how models evolve and learn.

### Unified Semantic Space in ConceptEvo
<img src="./data/fig/fig/neuron_emb_alignment.png" width="700">
This visualization represents concepts from various models in a single, cohesive space. By embedding and aligning neurons (depicted as dots), ConceptEvo maps similar concepts (such as a dog's face, a circle, or a car wheel) to corresponding locations, allowing for an intuitive comparison of different models.

### ConceptEvo in Action: Identifying Training Issues
<img src="./data/fig/fig/discovery-vgg16.png" width="700">
ConceptEvo's unified semantic space isn't just a visualization tool; it's also a powerful diagnostic instrument. It allows for the identification of potential issues in the training process by juxtaposing a well-trained model against one that is sub-optimally trained. 

- (a) **A well-trained VGG16** shows gradual concept formations and refinements. 
- (b) **A suboptimally trained VGG16** with a large learning rate rapidly loses the ability to detect most concepts. 
- (c) **An overfitted VGG16** without dropout layers shows slow concept evolutions despite rapid training accuracy increases. 

## Installation
Before diving into ConceptEvo, ensure you have the necessary packages. Installation is a breeze with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), Python's preferred package manager. 

Open your terminal and execute the following command:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will automatically install all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
